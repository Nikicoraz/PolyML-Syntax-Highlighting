# PolyML Syntax Highlighting
A language extension to add syntax highlighting support for PolyML using VSCode's TextMate. It highlights mostly what I've used while writing stuff, so some things may be missing.  

## Known Issues
- Doesn't recognize when curried functions are used
- Custom datatypes are not highlighted
